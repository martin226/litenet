# LiteNet

âš  **This project is solely for educational purposes. It is not intended to be used in production.**

LiteNet is a neural network framework written in C++ with 0 external dependencies. It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive API based on the Keras and PyTorch libraries. All linear algebra operations are implemented from scratch with the C++ standard library.

## Motivation

> Why make a neural network framework? Why in C++? Why no dependencies?

I wanted to learn more about neural networks and how they work under the hood. I also wanted to learn more about C++ and how to write efficient code. I decided to write a neural network framework in C++ with no dependencies to learn more about both of these topics.
