<h1 align="center">LiteNet</h1>

<p align="center">LiteNet is a neural network framework written in C++ with 0 external dependencies. It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive API based on the Keras    and PyTorch libraries. All linear algebra operations are implemented from scratch with the C++ standard library.</p>

## Motivation

> Why make a neural network framework? Why in C++? Why no dependencies?

I wanted to learn more about neural networks and how they work under the hood. I also wanted to learn more about C++ and how to write efficient code. I decided to write a neural network framework in C++ with no dependencies to learn more about both of these topics.

## Example Usage

For the full example, see [src/example_mnist.cpp](src/example_mnist.cpp).

```cpp
// Build
litenet::Model model;
model.add(std::make_unique<litenet::layers::Dense>(784, 64, "sigmoid", std::make_unique<litenet::initializers::GlorotUniform>()));
model.add(std::make_unique<litenet::layers::Dense>(64, 10, "sigmoid", std::make_unique<litenet::initializers::GlorotUniform>()));
model.compile("mean_squared_error", "sgd", 1);

// Train
model.fit(inputs, targets, 30, 64, validationInputs, validationTargets);

// Predict
litenet::Matrix predictions = model.predict(inputs);

// Evaluate
std::vector<double> results = model.evaluate(validationInputs, validationTargets);
std::cout << "Loss: " << results[0] << std::endl;
std::cout << "Accuracy: " << results[1] << std::endl;
```

Results: (on MNIST dataset, 3000 training samples, 100 validation samples)

```
Epoch 1 | loss: 0.621206 | val_loss: 0.669063
Epoch 2 | loss: 0.393079 | val_loss: 0.45329
...
Epoch 30 | loss: 0.0770367 | val_loss: 0.195699

Loss: 0.195699
Accuracy: 0.9
```
